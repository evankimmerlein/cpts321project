12/3/2022

This contains a website with a simple implementation of two-step verification via an email and password, along with a required code that is sent to the user through email.

NOTE: For this site to function properly, XAMPP must be installed with both Apache and MySQL services running. In addition, your sendmail.ini and php.ini files must be properly configured to send mail.
